# Z00
The only C function allowed in C is `write`. Based on this information, look for the equivalent in ZIG and print numbers and letters.

## Observation
There is no equivalent to `write` in zig. It can be imported and compiled as a C compatibility inclusion, but this is of little interest in the scope of this learning project. Therefore, I pass on this and hop to Z01.
